      <div class="item-7 item">
        <p>The American School of Antananarivo (ASA) was founded in September 1969 as an independent, non-sectarian,
          co-educational day school, located in the Nanisana area. In its beginnings, ASA offered classroom instruction
          in grades 1 – 8. It utilized a complemented Calvert Curriculum Course, and provided instruction in Music, Art,
          PE, and French language. In 1971, the school had 7 teachers and 45 students.</p>
        <br>
        <p>ASA moved to its second location in Ambodivoanjo Ivandry in 1972 where it remained for 45 years. As the
          student body increased, the school leased additional buildings throughout the years. Major improvements to the
          campus occurred in the 1990s with the construction of 7 prefabricated classrooms in 1991, a computer lab and
          media center and a PE field in 1996, and a stage in 1997.</p>
        <br>
        <p>1991 saw the completion of an entirely new school curriculum for all subject areas, and in April 1992, ASA
          achieved a milestone in its history by becoming accredited by the Middle States Association. The 1994-1995
          school year evolved through some pretty big changes, the biggest being the creation of the Middle School.
          Students in grades 5 – 8 were no longer in a self-contained classroom with one teacher, but changed classes
          and teachers throughout the day. This greatly improved the quality of instruction for our Middle School
          students. A computer lab was created for student use along with a separate computer curriculum for grades K-8.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In 2000, ASA celebrated its 30th anniversary which was marked by the formal establishment of a high school
          program and the graduation of the first senior, Cathy Cheerkot. At this time, the school had 16 teachers and
          107 students. From August 2008 to June 2014, the school’s Early Childhood Campus (Nursery – Kindergarten) was
          located in an annex in Ivandry.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On March 18, 2013, ASA became an IB school and was authorized by the International Baccalaureate Organization
          to offer the Primary Years Programme. In 2017, ASA moved to its present location in a three-acre campus in
          Lotissement Le Park Alarobia. With innovative and flexible learning spaces, state of the art science labs,
          performing arts hall, computer and mobile labs, art rooms, makerspaces, and multiple sports venues, this new
          campus is now home to more than 35 teachers and 260 students representing over 30 nationalities.</p>
